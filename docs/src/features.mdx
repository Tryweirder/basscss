## Lightning Fast Modular CSS with No Side Effects

- ### Code with Confidence

    Using clear, humanized naming conventions, Basscss is quick to internalize and easy to reason about while speeding up development time with more scalable, more readable code.

- ### No Side Effects

    Things behave exactly as expected with immutable utilities and styles that do one thing well to help prevent common pitfalls with CSS.

- ### Composable

    Reusable, interoperable styles work like building blocks to lay the foundation for any stylesheet and can be mixed and matched in any number of combinations.

- ### Designed for Design

    Basscss strikes a balance between consistency and flexibility to allow for rapid prototyping and quick iterative changes when designing in the browser.

- ### Responsive by Default

    Basscss provides lightweight, performant styles and flexible utilities to design for any device and to help reduce boilerplate in stylesheets.

- ### Unassuming

    Modular and customizable typography and layout styles donâ€™t dictate what things should look like and play well with other stylesheets and frameworks.
